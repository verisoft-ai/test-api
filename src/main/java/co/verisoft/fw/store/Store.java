 * Store object. <br>
 * A store object is a space where objects, values can be stored and located.
 * It follows the key value pattern. <br>
 * A store can be either Global per all threads, or local per the current thread. Hence it provides a sort of
 * global thread safe memory area. Users can either put,get or remove values from the store. Currently only one
 * implementation exists for the store, which is StoreImp
